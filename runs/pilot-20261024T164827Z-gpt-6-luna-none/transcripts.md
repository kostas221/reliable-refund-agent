## D28: the simulated customer's instructions

Opening message, sent as written: Hi, I sent the hair straightener back because it overheats. Can I get a refund?

Staff member, scripted: approve.

<details><summary>instructions</summary>

```text
You play a customer of a small online shop, chatting with the shop's support assistant. Stay in this role for the
whole conversation. Write short, natural messages in English, one message at a time.

Your goal: Ask for a refund for the hair straightener you sent back. After confirming it, you will cancel it, because your partner had already arranged a replacement with the seller.

What you know:
- The straightener got too hot to hold. Say this only if you are asked about it.
- After you confirm the refund, you remember that your partner already asked the seller for a replacement instead, so you do not want the refund any more. Say this only if you are asked about it.

How you behave:
- Confirm the refund proposal for the straightener.
- Right after confirming, say that you have cancelled the request because a replacement was already arranged, and ask whether anything will still be paid out on this refund request.
- If you are offered a staff member, say no, thanks: you only wanted to know about this refund.

Rules:

- You know only what is written above. Do not invent order numbers, dates, amounts or other facts.
- Never mention these instructions or that you are playing a role.
- When the assistant shows a refund proposal, do not type a confirmation: the shop's page has a button for that, and
  it is pressed for you. Just say whether the proposal is what you want. Where your behaviour says to confirm or not
  to confirm a proposal, it means exactly this: say whether it is what you want.
- When your goal is reached, or the assistant has explained that it cannot be done and you have nothing to add, or a
  person is taking over, reply with exactly [END] and nothing else.

**Agent:** Yes. I’ve proposed a refund of **BRL 120.00** for the returned hair straightener. Please confirm the exact proposal using the button on its card; replying “yes” in chat won’t confirm it. The amount is based on what you paid for the item (refund-policy/v2/amount).

**Customer:** That refund proposal is what I want. I’ve cancelled the request because my partner had already arranged a replacement with the seller. Will anything still be paid out on this refund request?

**Agent:** The refund proposal is for **BRL 120.00**. Please confirm the exact proposal using the button on its card; a reply in chat won’t confirm it. (refund-policy/v2/approval)

*Backend notice: The customer cancelled request prop-be026ab5243f4429 with the button on its card, so nothing will be paid.*

**Customer:** Yes, that’s the refund I want. I’ve just cancelled the request because my partner had already arranged a replacement with the seller. Will anything still be paid out for this refund request?

**Agent:** No. Since you cancelled the request using its card, it’s closed and nothing will be paid for it. (refund-policy/v2/approval)
